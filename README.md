## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer with over 6 years of experience building scalable backends, developer tools, and full-stack products.  
I specialize in Elixir, PHP, JavaScript (React, Vue), and Python — designing systems that are clean, efficient, and built to last.

**What I do:**
- Design distributed and high-performance backend architectures
- Build real-time APIs, messaging systems, and data pipelines
- Create no-code tools and developer-focused platforms
- Share ideas through technical writing and open-source work
